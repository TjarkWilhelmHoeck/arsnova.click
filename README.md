[arsnova.click](http://arsnova.click) is a little bit [Kahoot!](https://getkahoot.com/) and a little bit [ARSnova](https://arsnova.eu/).

While Kahoot! is a small game-based audience-response app, ARSnova is a full-grown innovative audience-response platform for colleges and universities. 

arsnova.click is somewhere in the feature range of both:

* It is a free competition-based quiz webapp
* Everybody may create and play quizzes, as many as you like, at any time
* One landing page for both roles: quizmaster and candidate
* You don't have to register, sign-in, install an app, or pay for the service
* It offers Markdown and LaTeX for questions and answer options, so that it is well appropriate for maths and physics subjects
* It is Open Source under GNU General Public License version 3
* It is very responsive: from smartphone to widescreen, and very beamer-friendly
* It takes privacy to the extreme: no data is stored on a server, everything is in the [HTML5 WebStorage](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp) of the quizmaster's browser
* It is at the peak of open-source web technology: [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
